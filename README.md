#### First Program ####

@brief  Search for biggest Subarray value of given Arrays. 
        To get Subarray value we need to use equasion:
        sum(i,j) = 3 * P + 2 * N
        i - index of first element in Subarray
        j - index of last element in Subarray
        P - positive element
        N - Negative element
        
@input  File with number of Arrays
                  size of array
                  Array*
*- absolute value of elements in Array cant be bigger than 2000               

@output File with copy of an original Arrays
                  i,j indexes of biggest Subarray
                  value of biggest Subarray

#### Second Program ####

@brief  Searches for number of occurances of selected elements in given collection with O(log (n)) complexity

@input  File  with size of collection
                   collection
                   number of searches*
                   elements to search
*- cant be bigger than size of collection and smaller than one

@output File with searched element
                  number of occurances
